## Description

NestJS API server for my personal website. Always a WIP.

I'm intending this to be a fairly generic setup, but its usefulness will always be in question.

## Configuration

See `example.env` for an example configuration setup.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn start

# watch mode
$ yarn start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn start:prod
```
